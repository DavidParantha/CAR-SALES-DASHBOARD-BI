# Car Sales Dashboard – Power BI

## Overview

This project presents an interactive **Car Sales Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Power BI**. The dashboard transforms historical car sales data into clear, decision-ready insights by combining structured data modeling, key performance indicators, and intuitive visualizations. It is designed to support both high-level performance monitoring and detailed analytical exploration.
 

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to build a centralized analytics solution for car sales data. The dashboard tracks key metrics such as **Total Sales**, **Average Selling Price**, **Total Cars Sold**, and **Average Cars Sold**, while enabling time-based and dimensional analysis across models, transmission types, colors, and regions.
 

## Dataset

The project uses a structured car sales transaction dataset containing vehicle attributes, pricing information, sales dates, seller details, and regional data. A dedicated **Calendar Table** is created and linked to the sales dataset to enable accurate time-based analysis and support future time-intelligence measures.
 

## Data Modeling

A star-schema design is implemented with:

* A **fact table** containing car sales transactions
* A **date dimension (Calendar Table)** for consistent filtering and time analysis

This modeling approach ensures reliable aggregations, proper slicer behavior, and scalable analytics.

## Dashboard Pages

### Page 1: Car Sales Dashboard (Overview)

This page provides a high-level view of business performance. It includes KPI cards for total sales, average selling price, and total cars sold, along with trend analysis, transmission distribution, geographic performance, and categorical insights. The layout is optimized for executive-level decision-making.

### Page 2: Car Sales | Details

This page supports detailed analysis through a transactional table view. Users can drill down into individual sales records and analyze performance by applying interactive slicers for year and model. It complements the overview page by enabling validation and granular exploration.

## Key Features

* Interactive KPI cards and dynamic slicers
* Time-based analysis using a calendar model
* Geographic and categorical performance insights
* Clean, scalable data model suitable for expansion
* User-friendly navigation between summary and detail views

---

## Tools and Technologies

* Microsoft Power BI
* Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
* DAX for calculated measures and KPIs

---

## Limitations

The dashboard is based on historical data and provides descriptive analytics only. It does not currently support real-time data updates, predictive modeling, or automated alerts.

 

## Future Enhancements

Future improvements may include sales forecasting, demand prediction, real-time data integration, advanced DAX measures, and automated performance alerts to enable proactive decision-making.

 
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete business intelligence workflow, from data preparation and modeling to interactive dashboard design. It showcases practical Power BI skills and serves as a strong portfolio project for analytics and business intelligence roles.
